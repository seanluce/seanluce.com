<p><strong>Hi! Thank you for taking the time to check us out :)</strong></p>

<p>We are Sean, Phoebe, Alexandria, Regan and Oakley (and our pup, Pixel). Sean and his kids have lived in Holland since 2015, but Phoebe just joined us (from Australia!) in 2019 which was the largest relocation of her life!</p>

<p>Regan and Oakley are at school at Lakeshore Elementary, Alex is in her first year of middle school, and Sean and Phoebe both work in IT. As a family, we share a love of hiking, travel, food, and having an impact on the world through diversity, communication, and technology!</p>

<p>We have been looking for "the right" house for what feels like *forever*: enough space for the kids and Pixel to run around while the adults get some work done, a house that we can build into a home. We see a home brimming with possibilities.</p> 
    
<p>We'd love to see the kids romping around in the beautiful backyard (love the tree fort!) while we sit on the back deck enjoying the Michigan summer (perhaps not the 'skeeters'). Cooking up a feast in the fantastic kitchen for family and friends when they visit for birthdays, holidays... or just because. And every evening having a cosy place to catch up on the day's happenings and building more memories together.</p>

<p>We wanted to share a little about us, because we'd like to think that you wouldn't just sell your beautiful home to just a name on a piece of paper. We can see the love and the thoughtfulness that you've put into building and living in your home, and we would like you to know that we would treasure it as well.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks so much for taking the time to meet us!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sean, Phoebe, Alex, Regan and Oakley (and Pixel too!)</strong></p>
